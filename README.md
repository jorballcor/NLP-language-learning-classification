## 🚀 Project Overview

**NLP Language Learning Classification** is a personal and ambitious project that blends **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **language learning** into a single innovative journey.  
The main objective is to **supercharge the acquisition of new languages** — starting with **French 🇫🇷** and **Romanian 🇷🇴** — using modern AI techniques.

This project is not just about building a model or processing vocabulary lists — it represents the **first step** of a much larger, continuous learning adventure.

## 🛠️ Key Features

### 📚 Vocabulary Dataset Preparation
- Cleaned and curated vocabulary lists from the **10,000 most common words** in French and Romanian.
- Organized and standardized text files, ready for AI processing.

### 🤖 AI-Driven Phrase Generation (Planned)
- Future phases will use **generative AI models** to create **natural sentences** using the vocabulary lists.
- Goal: **Realistic, everyday phrases** instead of isolated words.

### 🔊 Text-to-Speech Integration (Planned)
- Audio pronunciation of generated phrases using **Google Cloud Platform's Text-to-Speech API**.
- Reinforce learning through **real audio** and **listening practice**.

### 🧩 Language Learning Meets AI
- Combines two passions: **Language learning** and **AI/NLP technologies**.
- Emphasizes **creative learning**, **concept linking**, and **continuous discovery**.
